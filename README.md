Project Title: Mobile App Prototype for Managing Posts and Users

Description:
This project involves building a simple mobile app prototype using React Native to manage posts and users. Since the backend is not yet available, the app interacts with a fake REST API such as JSONPlaceholder or Reqres to simulate real backend operations.

The project includes the following key features:

API Exploration:
Fake APIs are tested using Postman to understand endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.

Fetching Data:
The app fetches and displays lists of posts and users using components like FlatList or custom cards.

CRUD Functionality for Posts:
Users can add, edit, and delete posts through forms and buttons, interacting with the API using appropriate HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE).

Error Handling and Loading States:
The app handles API delays, loading indicators (e.g., ActivityIndicator), and error messages gracefully to improve user experience.

Custom API Options:
Developers are encouraged to use tools like Mocky.io, Beeceptor, or JSON Server to create custom APIs that better reflect their app's use case and data structure.

UI Design Flexibility:
UI components are flexible and can be customized. Data may be shown in lists, cards, modals, or custom layouts depending on design preferences.

This project helps students understand how to interact with APIs in mobile development, manage application state, and create a fully functional prototype even before the backend is available.
